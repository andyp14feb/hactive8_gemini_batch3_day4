# Gemini AI Chatbot Web App

This project is a simple web-based chatbot application that leverages the Google Gemini AI to generate responses. It features a clean, vanilla JavaScript frontend and a Node.js Express backend.

## Project Context & Acknowledgements

This project is a submission for the **"AI Productivity and AI API Integration for Developers"** 4-day course. This program is a partnership between **Hacktiv8, AVPN, Google.org, and the Asian Development Bank**, and is part of the **AI Opportunity Fund: Asia Pacific initiative**.

## Features

-   **Interactive Chat Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for sending messages and receiving AI responses.
-   **Gemini AI Integration**: Utilizes the Google Gemini API for powerful and relevant conversational AI.
-   **Node.js Backend**: Handles API requests, integrates with Gemini, and serves static frontend files.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript Frontend**: A lightweight and efficient client-side implementation.

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend**:
    -   HTML5
    -   CSS3
    -   Vanilla JavaScript (`fetch` API)
-   **Backend**:
    -   Node.js
    -   Express.js
    -   `cors` (for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
    -   `dotenv` (for environment variable management)
    -   `@google/generative-ai` (Google Gemini API client library)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your Google Gemini API Key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

You can obtain a Gemini API Key from the Google AI Studio.

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on the port specified in your `index.js` (defaulting to `3000` or `3003` if you've changed it). You will see a message like:

```
Gemini Chatbot running on http://localhost: 3000
```

### 5. Access the Frontend

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
*(Adjust the port if your server is running on a different one, e.g., `http://localhost:3003`)*

## Usage

1.  Type your message into the input field at the bottom of the chat interface.
2.  Press Enter or click the "Send" button.
3.  The chatbot will display a "Gemini is thinking..." message.
4.  Once the response is generated by Gemini AI, it will appear in the chat box.
